Source code for the mod that adds in functional framework for exporting goods on your own railcars.
Since this directly patches into the programming of the game, I figured having this visible was better than not.

Technical:
Adds InterchangedIndustryUnloader, counterpart to in-game InterchangedIndustryLoader.
To use: Same as you would InterchangedIndustryLoader, but Unloader.
Note: This uses payPerQuantity instead of costPerUnit. A lot of loads(i.e. everything except logs and pulpwood) have it set to zero.

Does not contain demo mods. Those are simple enough to understand.
